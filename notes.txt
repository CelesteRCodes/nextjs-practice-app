NextJS is a framework (fullstack)

Page Pre-Rendering: 
  - w/ next js the first page is pre-rendered
    good for search engine but may not always be, could
    be missing info
    
  - once rendered, React takes over and hydrates code
    (refreshes, fully active/interactive, new data fetched)

  - 2 forms of pre-rendering (render first with data = pre-render):
  static generation and server side rendering
    - NextJS defaults static generation
     - getStaticProps() NextJs calls this first before component function 
      (searches for this function first)
      - function prepares props for this page, can only use on pages
      - can be asynchronous (waits for data to be loaded, waits for promise)
      - allows you to load data before component is rendered, so it
        can be rendered with the required data
      - any code inside function is only executed during build process, 
        never client side

      - cons of getStaticProps() : 
          - data could be outdated without client side data fetching
            - use revalidate prop: unlocks incremental static generation,
              time it'll wait before it regenerates page for incoming request
              - revalidate: 10, page would regenerate every 10 sec as long 
                as there's new data added
